This example demonstrates a common issue in Perl when iterating over hashes using the `each` function. The order of iteration is not guaranteed, and it might change between Perl versions or even different runs of the same script.  This can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to track down if the code relies on a specific iteration order. The solution provides an alternative approach to guarantee a specific order.
